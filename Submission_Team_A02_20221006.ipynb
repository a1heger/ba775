    "# Market Entry Analysis for Hawkeye Liquor Distributors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Our goal with this dataset is to perform a multi-level market analysis for Hawkeye Liquor Distributors (fictional) using SQL, with a focus on facilitating the following business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Location within Iowa__ - We will analyze which regions of Iowa have the highest/lowest sales, and make a recommendation on which areas would have the highest demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Type of Liquor__ - Based on the regional sales of different types of liquor, we will make an overall recommendation on the style(s) of liquor Hawkeye should distribute to the State of Iowa.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Pricing__ - For our recommended style(s) of liquor, we will advise Hawkeye on a fair price for distribution to the State of Iowa.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Distribution Channel Mix__ - Finally, we will determine which type of store (grocery, wholesale, convenience, etc.) will yield the highest sales for Hawkeye's liquor products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Brief: \n",
    "This dataset contains every wholesale purchase of liquor in the State of Iowa by retailers for sale to individuals since January 1, 2012. The State of Iowa controls the wholesale distribution of liquor intended for retail sale (off-premises consumption), which means this dataset offers a complete view of retail liquor consumption in the entire state. The dataset contains every wholesale order of liquor by all grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores, etc., with details about the store and location, the exact liquor brand and size, and the number of bottles ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset comprises 24,229,431 records (null and non-null) and occupies 6.4 GB of storage as of October 3, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to stop the ingest of new data into the table for our analysis, we froze the raw dataset in a table called `ba775-a02-fall22.main.sales` in our BigQuery project on October 3, 2022.  Our analysis is based on this extract of the original dataset cited above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data sourced from Iowa Department of Commerce via Google BigQuery.  See __[here](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/data)__.\n",
